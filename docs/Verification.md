# Verification Guide

## Prerequisites

Both TC Central and Teams lambda need to be up and running. They both need to have their endpoints exposed by ngrok. They also need events and interactive component endpoints configured in Slack and Teams.

So you will have two workspaces, 
one where TC Central bot is installed - `Topcoder Workspace`
and another where Teams bot is installed - `Client Workspace`

## Verification

1. Issue a command `@topbot request Create a topcoder bot` in a Ms Teams channel.
